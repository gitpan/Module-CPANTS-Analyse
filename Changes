0.72    2007-06-30
    - added docs to cpants_lint.pl 
    - cpants_lint.pl can now dump metadata to a file
    - added YAML output to cpants_lint.pl 
    Gabor Szabo:
    - added MCK::NeedsCompiler
      MCK::NeedsCompiler does not contain any kwalitee_indicator, but
      adds much needed metadata.
    Barbie:
    - MCA assumes Unix paths after munging with File::Spec, thus breaking 
      portability at every turn in a non-Unix-like environment
      ... bad Thomas no biscuit!
    Barbie:
    - Refined META.yml metrics using Test::YAML::Meta and brought 'current
      spec' up to date with version 1.3 :)


0.71    2007-04-23
    - moved svn repo to http://code.google.com/p/cpants/
    - has_license now also checks for LICENCE (as suggested by David
      Cantrell)
    - fixed RT #26535 reported by MTHURN
    - has_examples now also checks for p(m|od) file (as suggested by
      JUERD)
    - fixed RT #24228 reported by THALJEF - t/99_critic.t now only runs
      if $ENV{AUTHOR_TEST} is set
    - resolved RT #25198 reported by bdfoy using his patch
    - FindModules: do not check META.yml for provides because META.yml
      might list semi-garbage (eg according to META.yml, Siesta provides
      Apache::Constants, which it does not.)
    - skip very large test-files and only check *.t files (not everything
      in t/) as suggested by CASIANO
    - cpants_lint.pl:
        switched from Getopt::Std to Getopt::Long
        added --no_capture option for easier debugging
        added --verbose options
    - hopefully fixed RT #25207 (test failures on Win32) reported (and
      patched..) by HEMINGWAY. This should also solve RT #26535 reported
      by Martin Thurn
    - applied doc patch submitted by MSTEVENS as RT #26379


0.69    2006-11-04
    - splited up metayml_conforms_spec to metayml_conforms_spec_1_0

0.68    2006-10-28
    - fixed bug in MCK::FindModules reported by JDHEDDEN in RT #22081
      (the module name of modules living in the top-level namespace (eg
      'threads/pm') was not guessed correctly
    - use META.yml 'provides' (if it exists) instead of guessing module names in
      MCK::FindModules
    - modifed changelog-regex in MCK::Files as suggested by CDOLAN in 
      RT #21999
