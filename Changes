  - Fixed abstract encoding issues
  - Refactored tests
  - Fixed not to ignore directory symlinks
  - Fixed RT#97858 - wrong no_symlinks test in files not in MANIFEST
    (for a local distribution; CPANTS site doesn't ignore symlinks

    strict in Inline::CPP

0.93_02 2014-06-30

    build_prereq_matches_use

0.75 2007-10-29
  - added optional metric use_warnings

        "kwalitee_indicator", but adds much needed metadata.

  Barbie:
  - Module::CPANTS::Analyse assumes Unix paths after munging with
    File::Spec, thus breaking portability at every turn in a
    non-Unix-like environment… bad Thomas no biscuit!
    Refined META.yml metrics using Test::YAML::Meta and brought
    *current spec* up to date with version 1.3
    <http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-v1.3.html> :)

0.71 2007-04-23

  - resolved RT #25198 reported by bdfoy using his patch
    Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee::FindModules: do not check META.yml for
    "provides" because META.yml might list semi-garbage (eg
    according to META.yml, Siesta provides Apache::Constants, which
    it does not.)
  - skip very large test-files and only check *.t files (not
    everything in t/) as suggested by CASIANO

0.69 2006-11-04

0.68 2006-10-28
  - fixed bug in Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee::FindModules reported by
    JDHEDDEN in RT #22081 (the module name of modules living in the
    top-level namespace (eg 'threads.pm') was not guessed correctly
    use META.yml "provides" (if it exists) instead of guessing
    module names in Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee::FindModules

    suggested by CDOLAN in RT #21999
