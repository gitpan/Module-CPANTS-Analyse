    - renamed some error fields


0.78    2008-04-06
    * released at the Oslo QA Hackathon 2008
    - very hacky workaround for problems with Meta.YML, version 
      objects, etc
    - moved has_version_in_each_file into MCK::Version & fixed a bug
      in it 
    Gabor Szabo:
    - add fits_fedora_license metric that was inside the easily_repackageable_by_fedora metric
    - add is_experimental and is_aggregate flags to some of the metrics
    - unhide some errors during testing
    - add no_generated_files metric
    - add easily_repackageagble_by_fedora, easily_repackagable_by_debian
      and easily_repackageagble metric
    - add has_version_in_each_file metric
    - add has_tests_in_t_dir metric
    - add no_stdin_for_prompting metric checking for STDIN in Makefile.PL and Build.PL


0.77	2008-01-29
    - made 'prereq_matches_use' and 'build_prereq_matches_use' optional metrics
    - changed data structure: all errors are now in a hashref called 'error'


0.76    2007-11-14
    - added new metrics 'prereq_matches_use' and
      'build_prereq_matches_use'
    - added 'needs_db' to metrics and removed hardcoded workaround for
      is_prereq
    - removed workaround in MCK::MetaYML (Barbie fixed it the problem
      in Test::YAML::Meta)
    - reworded metayml_is_parsable remedy


0.75    2007-10-29
    - added optional metric use_warnings
    - added directory 'xt' as a potential location for test files:w
    - finally applied patch provided by Adriano Ferreira to fix some
      issues in MCK::Manifest. See RT #28982


0.74    2007-10-24
    - removed metric metayml_conforms_spec_1_0
    - fixed bug in MCK::MetaYML::check_spec_conformance, which caused 
      wrong results in metayml_conforms_spec*
    - switched to YAML::Syck
    - work around Pod::Simple::Checker returning strange data


0.73    2007-09-12
    - added version of dist to dump file name
    - fixed bug in MCK::NeedsCompiler (RT #28134 plus all reported merged
      into that one)


0.72    2007-06-30
    - added docs to cpants_lint.pl 
    - cpants_lint.pl can now dump metadata to a file
    - added YAML output to cpants_lint.pl 
    Gabor Szabo:
    - added MCK::NeedsCompiler
      MCK::NeedsCompiler does not contain any kwalitee_indicator, but
      adds much needed metadata.
    Barbie:
    - MCA assumes Unix paths after munging with File::Spec, thus breaking 
      portability at every turn in a non-Unix-like environment
      ... bad Thomas no biscuit!
    Barbie:
    - Refined META.yml metrics using Test::YAML::Meta and brought 'current
      spec' up to date with version 1.3 :)


0.71    2007-04-23
    - moved svn repo to http://code.google.com/p/cpants/
    - has_license now also checks for LICENCE (as suggested by David
      Cantrell)
    - fixed RT #26535 reported by MTHURN
    - has_examples now also checks for p(m|od) file (as suggested by
      JUERD)
    - fixed RT #24228 reported by THALJEF - t/99_critic.t now only runs
      if $ENV{AUTHOR_TEST} is set
    - resolved RT #25198 reported by bdfoy using his patch
    - FindModules: do not check META.yml for provides because META.yml
      might list semi-garbage (eg according to META.yml, Siesta provides
      Apache::Constants, which it does not.)
    - skip very large test-files and only check *.t files (not everything
      in t/) as suggested by CASIANO
    - cpants_lint.pl:
        switched from Getopt::Std to Getopt::Long
        added --no_capture option for easier debugging
        added --verbose options
    - hopefully fixed RT #25207 (test failures on Win32) reported (and
      patched..) by HEMINGWAY. This should also solve RT #26535 reported
      by Martin Thurn
    - applied doc patch submitted by MSTEVENS as RT #26379

    - fixed bug in MCK::FindModules reported by JDHEDDEN in RT #22081
      (the module name of modules living in the top-level namespace (eg
      'threads/pm') was not guessed correctly
    - use META.yml 'provides' (if it exists) instead of guessing module names in
      MCK::FindModules
